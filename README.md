# Chicago Food Inspections

The dataset can be found here https://data.world/cityofchicago/food-inspections-map

The only one that is quantitative might be the inspection date. There are some null values for "violations", though few enough that it should be acceptable to just not use those. The data has been cleaned, though it is a large set and they note that they may have missed some rows.

## Questions to ask

Are certain types of restaurants more prone to violations/higher risk levels?

Similarly can the types of violations be grouped or correlated based on type of facility?

Are the higher risk/lower risk values correlated with geographic location?

Do some of the chain restaurants share the risk levels across their locations, indicating an issue in overall policy, or are the issues only isolated to one or a few of their locations?

What locations need more attention to avoid being at risk. More analysis may be needed to see if these locations are profitable, or at least as profitable as their lower-risk counterparts. 

## For Stakeholders

Are competitors with either a high risk or lower risk store, able to make more of a profit than any of our locations in the same areas?

A cost vs risk analysis may be a helpful follow up.
